					<p>The Nottingham Sailing Club was founded in 1955 at its present 
					<a href="./location.html">location</a> on the West Bridgford bank of the River Trent. 
					At this point the river is wide and generally slow moving.  
					This offers some of the finest river sailing in the country.  
					The Clubhouse is situated close to the river bank giving a good 
					view of the sailing activities from the warmth and comfort of the 
					licensed bar and tea bar.  Changing rooms and showers are also
					 provided.  All of the land surrounding the Clubhouse is owned by
					  the Club and provides a large secure dinghy park, plenty of space
					   for rigging, launching from a concrete slip and a well-fendered 
					   jetty.  There is also ample car-parking and barbecue 
					   and picnic facilities.</p>

					<p>The Club's main activity is <a href="./racing.html">racing</a> with Saturday and Sunday races
					 from March to October and Thursday evening races from May to late August. 
					  There is also a Sunday frostbite series in November and December. 
					  The racing season culminates in a traditional Open Meeting on 
					  Boxing Day each year.  The Club Regatta takes place every year 
					  and fills a whole weekend of social activities along with the 
					  racing and fun sailing events. </p>

					<p>Many people enjoy their membership of the Club without ever
					 racing.  You can cruise upriver for about 2 miles, mainly through
					 pleasant countryside, as far as Lady Bay Bridge.  Downstream, 
					 there is a wide section of river approaching Holme Lock. 
					  Tuesday evenings are the most popular for cruising during the 
					 summer months.  There are rescue boats on the water and the bar 
					 is open for refreshments.  Members may however sail at any time 
					 from the Club, which is ideal for anyone who has time
					  available during the day.</p>

					<p>The Club is a recognised Royal Yachting Association training 
					establishment and runs "Learn to Sail Weekends" several times each
					 year.  These courses are intensive with a high teacher / pupil ratio, 
					 giving excellent value for money.  These weekends are open to
					  non-members of the Club.  The Club also runs Level 2 and Power Boat
					   courses for Members, and for Junior Members, junior training on 
					   Saturday afternoons throughout the summer.  There are many 
					   opportunities to improve your sailing skills, either crewing for
					    a more experienced helm or by purchasing your own boat. 
					     Advice on boat handling, rigging and tuning, repairs and
					     maintenance is readily available from most members. 
					      The club owns a fleet of seven Toppers, a single-handed boat
					      ideal for juniors. For the adults, there are two GP14s, 
					      two new RS Visions and a new RS Feva which are used extensively for teaching 
					      purposes and an Access Dinghy which is suitable for disabled 
					      sailors.  Safety on the water is paramount and the Club can 
					      provide personal buoyancy aids for organised training courses.  Rescue 
					      boats are on duty at these times and during racing. Life 
					      jackets must be worn at all times whilst on the water.</p>

					<p>As well as the sailing, the Club holds social events throughout
					 the year.  These cover many events not related to sailing, as well 
					 as the annual Regatta barbecue in the Summer and Prize giving
					  Buffet in the winter.</p>

					<p>For Non-Sailing Members, the countryside surrounding the Club
					 is excellent for walking and cycling.  The National Water S ports
					  Centre is within a few minutes walk and this offers a variety
					   of alternative entertainments, including the white water 
					   slalom course, cafes and a childrens' playground. </p>

					<p>Fancy a little river sailing for a change? The Nottingham
					 Sailing Club holds several Open Meetings throughout the year and
					  welcomes casual visitors at times when the Club is open, ( at a 
					  small charge ).</p>
